    visible: "visible" // Class added to images after they are loaded,
    zoom: "zoom" // Image container class
  }, {
    scaleDefault: 2, // Used on doubleclick, doubletap and resize
    scaleDifference: 0.5, // Used on wheel zoom
    scaleMax: 10, // Maximum zoom
    scaleMin: 1, // Minimum zoom
    scrollDisable: true, // Disable page scrolling when zooming an image
    transitionDuration: 200, // This should correspond with zoom-transition transition duration
    doubleclickDelay: 300 // // Delay between clicks - used when scripts decides if user performed doubleclick or not
  }, (function ($container, zoomed) {
    console.log(zoomed); // Callback, gets triggered whenever active class is added/removed from container, value of zoomed is true or false
  }));
```

## Supported Events

- doubleclick
- mousemove
- mousewheel
- doubletap
- touchmove
- pinch

## Additional Info

Plugin checks if image container (zoom) exists on window.load and executes for each element with image container class. If there is no element with specified class present, then it stops.
- It means, that there is no need to check if image container (zoom) exists before executing the zoom function
